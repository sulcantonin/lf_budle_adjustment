I. Introduction 

This package contains a matlab implementation of our ICCV'15 paper on 
structure from motion for light fields and, in addition, the bundle adjustment
implementation of the ACCV'16 paper on layered scene reconstruction.

In case you use our code please cite our papers mentioned in the header.



II. Running examples on our data

We prepared two examples, 
- a synthetic dataset 
    http://lightfield-analysis.net/accv2016_ba_data_synthetic.zip
- a Lytro Illum example 
    http://lightfield-analysis.net/accv2016_ba_data_lytro.zip

Extract both into the "data" folder.

For the synthetic example please run the example.m file, for the Lytro Illum 
example the example_lytro.m file.



III. Running examples on other Lytro Illum datasets

We received many questions about how to run our code on other light fields 
from Lytro Illum. The entry requirement is to have an intrinsic calibration done, 
namely the H matrix (\cite{Dansereau_2013_CVPR}) needs to be computed. 
The calibration can be performed with the Light Field Toolbox 4.0 
(available online at http://dgd.vision/Tools/). 
You will need to take the following steps.

III.a. Download and install Light Field Toolbox 4.0 or newer
Available online http://dgd.vision/Tools/

III.b. Calibration
- Print a checkerboard calibration pattern with known parameters (or measure them)
- The checkerboard must have an unequal number of corners
- Take a few (~15) pictures of the checkerboard from slightly different angles
  without changing any parameters (focus, zoom). The wider side of checkerboard 
  must be horizontally aligned with the camera.

III.c. Copy decoding information from your Lytro and Decode the calibration images
- Add the Light Field Toolbox to your MATLAB path
- There should be a folder on your Lytro called IllumCaldata, copy it somewhere. 
- Copy the pictures of the calibration checkerboard somewhere and change your 
  MATLAB directory to the directory $PATH/IllumCaldata. 
- Run command 
    "LFUtilDecodeLytroFolder($DECODE_FOLDER);"
  where DECODE_FOLDER is a folder with your newly captured checkerboard

III.d. Calibrate 
- Set up calibration settings, checkerboard size, and spacing between boxes (in mm):
    CalOptions.ExpectedCheckerSize = [$NUM_HORIZONTAL,$NUM_VERTICAL];
    CalOptions.ExpectedCheckerSpacing_m = [$WIDTH, HEIGHT];
    CalOptions.LensletBorderSize = 2;
  The last line usually gives better results.
- Run calibration
    LFUtilCalLensletCam($DECODE_FOLDER, CalOptions);
- After this add the calibration into your database by running command
    LFUtilProcessCalibrations

III.e. Rectify your calibrated light fields
- Now you can take new images with the same settings (even a small change can have a 
  significant influence on quality) Please note, that there is an option to lock
  focus and focallength for the Lytro Illum.
- Run 
    DecodeOptions.OptionalTasks = 'Rectify';
    LFUtilDecodeLytroFolder($NEW_LYTRO_LIGHTFIELDS, [], DecodeOptions);
  where NEW_LYTRO_LIGHTFIELDS is a folder with newly captured light fields. Light field toolbox automatically adds the calibration matrix to the structures
